# Pipelines

This section contains walkthrough guides for some common pipelines you may want to use in your manifest files. 
These pipelines only use plugins from our standard library that comes bundled with IF and do not require any third party plugins to be installed. They all work out of the box with IF.

These walkthroughs will help you to understand how complex operations can be implemented using simple generic features and provide templates that you cna use,modify or chain together in your own workflows.

The pipeline guides include:

- [Teads CPU energy](./teads.md)
- [Cloud instance metadata](./instance-metadata.md)

You can find the manifests themselves in your copy of IF in `manifests/examples` or find them on our [Github](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if/tree/main/manifests/examples).
