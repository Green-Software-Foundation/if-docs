# Pipeline Examples

This section contains walkthrough guides for some common pipelines you may want to use in your IMP files. 

These pipelines only use plugins from our standard library that comes bundled with IF and do not require any third party plugins to be installed. They all work out of the box with IF.

These walkthroughs will help you to understand how complex operations can be implemented using simple generic features and provide templates that you can use, modify or chain together in your own workflows.

The pipeline guides include:

- [CPU utilization -> carbon emissions](./cpu-to-carbon.md)
- [Basic observations -> Software Carbon Intensity](./sci.md)
- [Grabbing cloud instance metadata from csv file](./instance-metadata.md)
- [Teads CPU pipeline](./teads.md)

You can find the IMPs themselves in your copy of IF in `manifests/examples` or find them on our [Github](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if/tree/main/manifests/examples).
