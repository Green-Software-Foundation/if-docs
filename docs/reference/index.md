# Reference

In this section you will find reference documentation for the core data structures and features used in the Impact Framework.

This includes:

- [CLI](cli.md)
- [Errors](errors.md)
- [Plugins](plugins.md)
- [IF features](features.md)

These are developer focused reference docs. If you are not a developer and looking for usage guides, please head over to the [`Using IF`](../using-if/) section.
