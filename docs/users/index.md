# Users

This section contains information for Impact Framework users. You are a user if you want to apply the Impact Framework to your own use-case, such as using it to measure the environmental impact of your own apps running on some cloud platform. 

The user documentation includes:

- [How to install and run IF](./how-to-install-if.md)
- [How to load plugins](./how-to-import-models.md)
- [How to write manifest files](./how-to-write-impls.md)
- [How to use the Azue Importer](./how-to-use-azure-vm.md)


If you are loking for guidance for how to *change or update* the Impact Framework by adding new features, fixing bugs or building new plugins, you should go to our [`developers` documentation](../developers/) instead.
