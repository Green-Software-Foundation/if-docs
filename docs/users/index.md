# Users

This section contains information for Impact Framework users. You are a user if you want to apply the Impact Framework to your own use-case, such as using it to measure the environmental impact of your own apps running on some cloud platform. 

The user documentation includes:

- [Quick start guide](./quick-start.md)
- [How to install and run IF](./how-to-install-if.md)
- [How to load plugins](./how-to-import-plugins.md)
- [How to write manifest files](./how-to-write-manifests.md)
- [How to export CSV file with `if-csv`](./how-to-export-csv-file-with-if-csv.md)
- [How to compare files with `if-diff`](./how-to-compare-files-with-if-diff.md)
- [How to check parameters and units using `explain`](./using-the-explain-feature.md)
- [How to verify manifest files with `if-check`](./how-to-verify-files-with-if-check.md)

If you are looking for guidance for how to *change or update* the Impact Framework by adding new features, fixing bugs or building new plugins, you should go to our [`developers` documentation](../developers/) instead.
