# Quick start

This page will provide the basic instructions for getting up and running with Impact Framework.

## 1: Install Impact Framework

Install the Impact Framework globally using npm.

```sh
npm install -g @grnsft/if
```

Read our detailed guide to [installing IF](./how-to-install-if.md).

## 2: Install some plugins

Install some of the plugins you want to include in your pipeline. The following commands will install both the official and unofficial IF model packages.

```sh
npm install -g @grnsft/if-plugins
npm install -g @grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins
```

Read our detailed guide to [loading plugins](./how-to-import-plugins.md).

## 3: Create a manifest file

A manifest file contains all the configuration and input data required to measure your application's energy and carbon impacts and should have a `.yml` extension. 

Open the file, add your data and save the file. The simple example below runs a single snapshot observation through a single plugin.

```yaml
name: basic-demo
description:
tags:
initialize:
  plugins:
    teads-curve: 
      path: '@grnsft/if-unofficial-plugins'
      method: TeadsCurve
      global-config:
        interpolation: spline
tree:
  children:
    child-0:
      defaults:
        cpu/thermal-design-power: 100
      pipeline:
        - teads-curve
      inputs:
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
          duration: 1
          cpu/utilization: 20
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:01
          duration: 1
          cpu/utilization: 80
        - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:02
          duration: 1
          cpu/utilization: 20
```

Read our detailed guide to [writing manifest files](./how-to-write-manifests.md).

## 4: Compute your manifest file

Run the pipeline by passing the path to your manifest file to the `if-run` command line tool:

```sh
if-run --manifest <path-to-your-manifest>
```

:tada:**Congratulations** :tada:! You have just used the Impact Framework to compute the energy consumed by an application! 

## Next steps

Now you know how to use the `if-run` you can start building more complex pipelines of plugins and more complicated manifest files. Your overall aim is to create a manifest file that accurately represents a real software application, and a plugin pipeline that yields an environmental metric that's important to you (e.g. `carbon`).

Experiment by adding more plugins to the pipeline, for example add `sci-o` to convert energy into `operational-carbon`. Your output data will be displayed in your console. 

You can also configure `if` to save your output data to another `yaml` file. To do this, add the `--output` flag and the path to the output file where the results are saved.

The command is then as follows:

```sh
if-run --manifest <path-to-your-impl> --output <save-path>
```
