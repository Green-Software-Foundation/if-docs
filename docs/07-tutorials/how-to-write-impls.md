# IMPL writing guide

The Impact Framework receives all its configuration and input data in the form of a `yaml` file known as an `impl` (input-yaml).
To use the framework, a user only has to write an `impl` file and pass its path to the command line tool. This guide will help you to understand how to construct an `impl` and use it to measure the energy and carbon usage of your app.

## Structure of an `impl`

The basic structure of an `impl` is very simple.

```yaml
name:
description:
tags:
initialize:
  models:
    - name:
      model:
      path:
graph:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        -
      config:
      inputs:
```

The `impl` starts with some metadata about the project, specifically:

- `name`
- `description`
- `tags`.

There is no strict specfication for how these field are used; they are for you to keep track of your impls and to provide the necessary details for other users to understand your use case.

## `initialize`

The next field is `initialize`. This is where you specify each individual model that will be instantiated in your pipeline. The models can be initialized in any order. Models cannot be invoked elsewhere in the `impl` if they have not been initialized by including them in this field. Models are initialized by providing their name and some configuration data. For example:

```yaml
initialize:
  - name: sci-m
    path: ''
    model:
```

`name` has to be precisely the model name recognized by IEF. You can check all the valid model names [here](../src/util/models-universe.ts). `path` defines where `IF` should look for the installed model, for example for our standard library of models you would specify `"@grnsft/if-models"`, as this is the name of the directory they are installed into in `node_modules`. For `model` you are expected to provide the name of the class your mdoel instantiates, fopr example for the `sci-e` model the correct value is `SciEModel`.

## `graph`

`graph` is where you define the various components of your application. `graph` is organized into `children`. Each `child` is a component whose outputs should be summed to give the overall impact of your `graph`. `children` can be nested with arbitrary depth. Each `child` can have its own model pipeline and its own config. When no config is provided, it is inherited from the `graph` level config.

In the following example, there is only one component. The model pipeline contains two models, `teads-curve` and `sci-m`. Neither require any `config` data but they do expect certain information to be available in `inputs`.

```yaml
graph:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        - teads-curve
        - sci-m
      config:
      inputs:
        - timestamp: '2023-11-02T10:35:31.820Z'
          duration: 3600
          total-embodied-emissions: 1533.12
          time-reserved: 1
          expected-lifespan: 3
          resources-reserved: 1
          total-resources: 8
          cpu-util: 50
          thermal-design-power: 300
```

## `inputs`

Each `child` has its own set of `inputs`. These are the most granular data, each of which are associated with a specific timestamp. Every `input` must always include a `timestamp` and a `duration`.

```yaml
inputs:
  - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
    duration: 3600
    cpu-util: 45
```

That's it! You now have a simple `impl` file that will use the model config and input data to run the `teads-curve` and `sci-m` models! The output data will be appended to the `impl` under a new `outputs` field and saved as an `ompl` file.

## More complex `impls`

### Complex pipelines

The basic `impl` in the previous section is valid, but it is minimal and doesn't return very interesting output data. We expect most users will want to calculate an SCI score, which requires both `operational-carbon` and `embodied-carbon` as inputs, which requires `sci` to be preceded by `sci-m` and `sci-o` in the model pipeline. In most cases, `sci-o` will have to be preceded by `sci-e` to ensure `energy` is available to be piped to `sci-o`. And, most likely, the inputs to `sci-e` will be coming from a model such as `teads-curve`. The `sci` model also requires `functional-unit` information so it can convert the estimated `carbon` into a useful unit. Youmay also wish to grab your `input` data by querying a metrics API on a virtual machine. In the example below, this full pipeline is implemented in an `impl` (if you have an Azure virtual machine and put your credentials in a `.env` file, you can run this `impl` to retrieve your SCI score).

```yaml
name: if-demo
description: demo pipeline
tags:
initialize:
  models:
    - name: azure-importer
      model: AzureImporterModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-unofficial-models'
    - name: cloud-instance-metadata
      model: CloudInstanceMetadataModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
    - name: teads-curve
      model: TeadsCurveModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-unofficial-models'
    - name: sci-e
      model: SciEModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
    - name: sci-o
      model: SciOModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
    - name: sci-e
      model: SciEModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
    - name: sci-m
      model: SciMModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
    - name: sci
      model: SciModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
graph:
  children:
    child:
      pipeline:
        - azure-importer
        - cloud-instance-metadata
        - teads-curve
        - sci-e
        - sci-o
        - sci-m
        - sci
      config:
        sci-o:
          grid-carbon-intensity: 951
        sci:
          functional-unit: ''
          functional-unit-time: 1 hour
          functional-unit-duration: 1
      inputs:
        - timestamp: '2023-11-02T10:35:31.820Z'
          duration: 3600
          azure-observation-window: 5 min # value and unit must be space separated
          azure-observation-aggregation: 'average'
          azure-subscription-id: 9ed7b18c-8a28-5b73-9451-45fc74e7d0d3
          azure-resource-group: vm1_group
          azure-vm-name: vm1
          total-embodied-emissions: 1533.12
          time-reserved: 300
          expected-lifespan: 94348800 # 3 yrs in seconds
          resources-reserved: 1
          total-resources: 64
          cpu-util: 50
          thermal-design-power: 65
```

### Complex applications

The `impl` examples provided so far have only had a single component. However, IEF can handle any number of `children` that can be nested.
The following snippet shows how you can nest multiple subcomponents.

```yaml
name: nesting-demo
description:
tags:
  kind: web
  complexity: moderate
  category: on-premise
initialize:
  models:
    - name: teads-curve
      model: TeadsCurveModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-unofficial-models'
    - name: sci-e
      model: SciEModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
    - name: sci-m
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
      model: SciMModel
    - name: sci-o
      model: SciOModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
    - name: sci
      model: SciModel
      path: '@grnsft/if-models'
graph:
  children:
    server: # an advanced grouping node
      pipeline:
        - teads-curve
        - sci-e
        - sci-m
        - sci-o
        - sci
      config:
        sci:
          functional-unit-time: 1 minute
          functional-duration-time: ''
          functional-unit: requests # factor to convert per time to per f.unit
      children:
        nested-1:
          inputs:
            - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
              duration: 10
              cpu-util: 50
              thermal-design-power: 65
              e-net: 0.000811 #kwh
              requests: 380
              total-embodied-emissions: 251000 # gCO2eq
              time-reserved: 3600 # 1 hour in s
              expected-lifespan: 126144000 # 4 years in seconds
              resources-reserved: 1
              total-resources: 1
              grid-carbon-intensity: 451
        nested-2:
          inputs:
            - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
              duration: 10
              cpu-util: 33
              thermal-design-poiwer: 65
              e-net: 0.000811 #kwh
              requests: 380
              total-embodied-emissions: 251000 # gCO2eq
              time-reserved: 3600 # 1 hour in s
              expected-lifespan: 126144000 # 4 years in seconds
              resources-reserved: 1
              total-resources: 1
              grid-carbon-intensity: 451
```

You can combine complex model pipelines and complex application architectures to calculate the energy and carbon outputs of complicated systems!

## Choosing which models to run

The models are designed to be composable, but they each have specific input requirements that must be met in order for the models to run correctly. For example, the `teads-curve` model requires `thermal-design-power` to be available in the `impl`. If it is not there, the model cannot use it to calculate `e-cpu`. You can refer to the [individual model documentation](../05-models.md) to see the parameters and return values for each model.

it is also possible to leapfrog some models if you have access to high-level data. For example, perhaps you already know the energy being used by your CPU. In this case, there is no need to run `teads-curve`, you can simply provide `e-cpu` as an `input` and omit `teads-curve` from the model pipeline.

We have deliberately made the models modular and composable so that you can be creative in developing new plugins to replace those provided as part of IEF.

## Running an `impl`

You run an impl by providing its path to our command line tool, along with a path to save the results file to. You can run an `impl` named `my-impl.yml` as follows:

```sh
npx ts-node scripts/impact.ts --impl ./examples/impls/my-impl.yml --ompl ./examples/ompls/my-ompl.yml
```
