# Developers

This section contains information for Impact Framework developers. You are a developer if you want to _change or update_ the Impact Framework by adding new features, fixing bugs or building new plugins.

The developer documentation includes:

- [How to build plugins](./how-to-build-plugins.md)
- [How to make plugins production-ready](./how-to-refine-plugins.md)
- [How to write unit tests](./how-to-write-unit-tests.md)
- [How to create exhaust scripts](./how-to-create-exhaust-script.md)

If you are looking for guidance for how to use IF to measure the environmental impact of your apps, you should go to our [`user` documentation](../users/) instead.
