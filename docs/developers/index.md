# Developers

This section contains information for Impact Framework developers. You are a developer if you want to *change or update* the Impact Framework by adding new features, fixing bugs or building new plugins. 

The developer documentation includes:

* [How to build plugins](./how-to-build-plugins.md)
* [How to make plugins production-ready](./how-to-refine-plugins.md)
* [How to write unit tests](./how-to-write-unit-tests.md)
* [How to visualize results](./how-to-visualize-results.md)


If you are looking for guidance for how to use IF to measure the environmental impact of your apps, you should go to our [`user` documentation](../users/) instead.
