# How to write unit tests 

Impact Framework unit tests follow a standard format. We use the `jest` testing library. You can run all our existing tests by opening the project directory and running `npm test`. This page explains how you can add new unit tests for your plugins (or add some for our plugins if you notice a gap).

## Test files

Both the IF and the project repositories include a `__test__` directory. Inside, you will find subdirectory `unit/lib` containing directories for each plugin. Your plugin repository should also follow this structure. Inside the plugin directory you can add `index.test.ts`. This is where you write your unit tests. For example, here's the directory tree for our `teads-curve` test file:


```sh

if-unofficial-models
 |
 |- src
    |
    |-__tests__
        |
        |-unit
          |
          |-lib
             |
             teads-curve
                 |
                 |- index.test.ts
```


## Setting up your test file

You will need to import your plugin so that it can be instantiated and tested. You will also need some elements from `jest/globals`:
For example, these are the imports for our `Sum` plugin.

```ts
import {Sum} from '../../../../lib';
import {ERRORS} from '../../../../util/errors';
const {InputValidationError} = ERRORS;
```

You may require other imports for your specific set of tests.

## Describe

Each method should have its own dedicated `describe` block. 

Your unit tests should have *at least* two `describe` blocks, one to test the plugin initialization and one for `execute`.

```ts
describe("init", ()=> {})
describe("execute", ()=> {})
```

For example, here is a describe block checking that the `Sum` plugin initializes correctly:

```typescript
describe('lib/sum: ', () => {
  describe('Sum: ', () => {
    const globalConfig = {
      'input-parameters': ['cpu/energy', 'network/energy', 'memory/energy'],
      'output-parameter': 'energy',
    };
    const sum = Sum(globalConfig);

    describe('init: ', () => {
      it('successfully initalized.', () => {
        expect(sum).toHaveProperty('metadata');
        expect(sum).toHaveProperty('execute');
      });
    });
  })
})
```

## It

Within each `describe` block, each effect to be tested should have a dedicated `it` block.

Here's an example of a new `describe` block for the `execute()` method on the `Sum` plugin. The `describe` block indicates that we are testing effects of the `execute()` method. `it` is specific to a single outcome - in this case there are two `it` blocks that test that the plugin returns a specific result in the happy path and throws an exception if the user has provided invalid config data, specifically that the user-provided `cpu/energy` parameter is missing:

```typescript
    describe('execute(): ', () => {
      it('successfully applies Sum strategy to given input.', async () => {
        expect.assertions(1);

        const expectedResult = [
          {
            duration: 3600,
            'cpu/energy': 1,
            'network/energy': 1,
            'memory/energy': 1,
            energy: 3,
            timestamp: '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z',
          },
        ];

        const result = await sum.execute([
          {
            duration: 3600,
            'cpu/energy': 1,
            'network/energy': 1,
            'memory/energy': 1,
            timestamp: '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z',
          },
        ]);

        expect(result).toStrictEqual(expectedResult);
      });

      it('throws an error on missing params in input.', async () => {
        const expectedMessage =
          'Sum: cpu/energy is missing from the input array.';

        expect.assertions(1);

        try {
          await sum.execute([
            {
              duration: 3600,
              timestamp: '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z',
            },
          ]);
        } catch (error) {
          expect(error).toStrictEqual(
            new InputValidationError(expectedMessage)
          );
        }
      });
    })
```


## Errors

We prefer to use `expect` to check the errors returned from a test. We do this by writing `expect` in a `catch` block. Here's an example from our `sci` plugin tests:

```ts
it('throws an exception on missing functional unit data.', async () => {
  const inputs = [
    {
      timestamp: '2021-01-01T00:00:00Z',
      'operational-carbon': 0.002,
      'embodied-carbon': 0.0005,
      'functional-unit': 'requests',
      duration: 1,
    },
  ];
  expect.assertions(1);

  try {
    await sciModel.execute(inputs);
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(InputValidationError);
  }
});
```

It is also necessary to include `expect.assertions(n)` for testing asynchronous code, where `n` is the number of assertiosn that should be tested before the test completes. 

## Mocks

Please try to avoid mocking data if possible. However, if it is necessary to mock (e.g. if your plugin relies on a third party credentialed API) then please make your mock data as realistic as possible (no `foo`, `bar`, `baz` style mock data, please).

We do have mock backends in several of our tests, and we also have a mock data generator plugin that can create realistic dummy data to your specific requirements.

## Coverage

Please use `jest --coverage` to see a coverage report for your plugin - your unit tests should yield 100% coverage. The snippet below shows what to expect from the coverage report:

```sh
-------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
| File                        | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
