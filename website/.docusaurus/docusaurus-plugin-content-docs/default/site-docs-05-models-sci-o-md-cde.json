  "description": "Operational emissions refer to the carbon generated by a component while it is in use. It is the product of the energy used by the component in kWh and the grid intensity in gCO2e/kWh. The operational emissions are added to the embodied emissions (calculated using sci-m) to provide an overall SCI score for the component.",
