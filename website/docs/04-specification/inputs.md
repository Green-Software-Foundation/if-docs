# Inputs

`inputs` are a core component of an [Impact Graph](Impact%20Graph.md) (graph), and they form the primary input into an [Impact Model Plugin](Impact%20Model%20Plugin.md) (model).

An **input** is something you measure regarding a component in your software system. For example, an `input` about a server might be CPU utilization. `inputs` are passed into models which generate impact metrics.

Different models require different kinds of `inputs`. If a model converts billing data to carbon emissions, the `inputs` must include billing information. `inputs` can be varied, billing data, utilization, number of users over time, responses from a survey, they can be anything at all.

- All `inputs` have a **timestamp** and **duration**.
- `inputs` can be n-dimensional; each time and duration can have multiple values, e.g., CPU and Mem utilization.
- `inputs` are always a time series. Even if you only pass in one `input` with a long duration, it's still a time series with one entry.

In [Impl (Impact YAML)](Impl%20(Impact%20YAML).md), `inputs` are expressed like so:

```yaml
  series:      
	- timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00
	  duration: 5
	  cpu: 0.34
	- timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:05
	  duration: 5
	  cpu: 0.23
	- timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:05
	  duration: 5
	  cpu: 0.11
```

But they can also be stored in CSV files like so:

| Timestamp           | Duration | CPU | Mem | Disk |
| ------------------- | -------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 2023-07-26T13:00:00 | 15       | 23  | 87  | 2    |
| 2023-07-26T13:00:15 | 15       | 26  | 86  | 4    |
| 2023-07-26T13:00:30 | 15       | 46  | 76  | 6    |
| 2023-07-26T13:00:45 | 15       | 2   | 60  | 10   |
| 2023-07-26T13:01:00 | 15       | 4   | 55  | 1    |

#### Default Units and Names

Each type of `input` has a **default unit** and **default name**. For example, if you observe a CPU utilization, the name of the input dimension is `cpu`, and the unit is as a `percentage`. Aggregation method is `avg`. The data passed in is expected to be in that format.


| Dimension | Unit                      |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| CPU       | Percentage Utilized       |
| MEM       | Percentage Full           |
| Disk      | Total Read/Writes         |
| Duration  | Seconds                   |
| Timestamp | ISO8601/RFC3339 Timestamp |



## `input` synchronization

Each component in your graph needs `inputs`; we need inputs to compute outputs.

A helpful feature of the engine is that you don't need to synchronize all your `inputs` for all your components with each other. You can provide `inputs` at different intervals for every component in the graph.

In the [](Computation%20Pipeline.md#Normalization|Normalization) phase of the computation of a graph, we do synchronize the output Impact Metrices, but we don't need the `inputs` synchronized to do this.

### How does an `input` differ from Telemetry?

Telemetry is the automatic recording and transmission of very fine-grain data about a software system from remote sources. You can gather an `input` from anything, **including human judgment**, assumptions, other models, survey data, and spreadsheets. `inputs` tend to be at a higher grain, with durations more likely in the range of 5 mins to an hour. `inputs` and telemetry work hand in hand; `inputs` will usually be collected by querying a system that has collected Telemetry to create a time series, for example, Prometheus.

### `inputs` drive temporal granularity

As discussed in the [Granularity](Granularity.md) design document, an essential feature of the [Impact Engine Framework](Impact%20Engine%20Framework.md) is to provide a granular analysis of the impacts of a software system.

One dimension of granularity is time, and `inputs` are how we provide that temporal granularity.

You can provide one single `input` for a long duration for every component in an [Impact Graph](Impact%20Graph.md); however, this won't give you a view of how the impacts changed over time. 

This is why `inputs` are a time series; the more inputs you can provide about components over time, the more the engine can surface impacts over time.

Another reason to provide multiple `inputs` is to gain a much more accurate emissions estimate. Many of the models used to translate `inputs` into outputs are non-linear. This means just providing an average value over time will give you a less accurate value than providing more data points over time.
